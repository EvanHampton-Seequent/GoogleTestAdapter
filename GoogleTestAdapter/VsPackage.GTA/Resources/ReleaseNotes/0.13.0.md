* The new option *Additional PDBs* allows to provide additional PDBs for finding source file locations. This is useful if GTA is not able to find the according PDBs automatically.
* enhancement: options *Working directory*, *Test setup batch file*, *Test teardown batch file*, *Additional PDBs*, *PATH extension*, and *Additional test execution parameters* now support the usage of environment variables (to be provided in the form `%VAR_NAME%`). Not that this is a **breaking change**: *Test setup batch file* and *Test teardown batch file* have until now been interpreted locally to the solution directory. This is not the case any more. If you use these options, prefix your current setting with `$(SolutionDir)` to maintain the old behavior.
